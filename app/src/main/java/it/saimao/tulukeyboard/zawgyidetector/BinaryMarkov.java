/**
 * A class that behaves as if it were two Markov chains, called Chain A and Chain B. Whereas a
 * normal Markov chain would expose the log probability of a transition, this class exposes the
 * difference between the log probabilities of the two Markov chains. When training, you can specify
 * which Markov chain a transition should be added to.
 *
 * <p>The reasoning behind this class is that it has a smaller data footprint than two separate
 * Markov chain objects.
 *
 * <p>This class is tested in the myanmar-tools-training package because this implementation does
 * not include any logic for building a new instance other than from a binary data stream.
